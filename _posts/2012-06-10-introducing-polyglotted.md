My name is Shankar Vasudevan, a developer and architect, working for a leading
investment bank within the London city. I have been architecting large scale
enterprise applications for the past 15 years. You can visit my [professional
profile](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/vshank77) on LinkedIn or follow me 
[@vshank77](http://twitter.com/#!/vshank77) on Twitter.

Over the past 15 years, I have grown a great fascination for data storage and 
analysis. The advent of Big Data and NoSQL in the recent years have got me
drooling and my professional work in the fields of information retrieval,
analytical processing, adword classification and scoring, enterprise search
have added fuel to the fire. More recently I have become a true believer of 
[Polyglot Persistence](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PolyglotPersistence.html)
a keyword coined by [Martin Fowler](www.martinfowler.com) and apply the 
philosophy in day-to-day job.

Polyglotted.org is to give back to the community, projects that I conceive 
in the area of information analysis and polyglot persistence.


If you are still interested, Martin Fowler has an interesting introduction 
to [NoSQL Databases and Polyglot Persistence](http://martinfowler.com/
articles/nosql-intro.pdf)
